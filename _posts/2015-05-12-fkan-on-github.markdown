**Hello, World.**

Several members of the [FKAN](http://fluorideindia.org) have felt the need to collect data, knowledge and solutions on Fluoride and Fluorosis in India. These [Github repositories](https://github.com/fkanlab) are an attempt to a address that need.

Data sets are being hosted [here](https://github.com/fkanlab/data). In the coming days we hope to build a sizeable collection of data sets, all properly attributed, licensed and described. An [example data set](https://github.com/fkanlab/data/example) has been put up in the format we hope to use. These are early days, and feedback on the data structure and metadata are much appreciated. Post suggestions as an [issue](https://github.com/fkanlab/data/issues), but please take the time to see if these have been discussed already. A mechanism to accept data contributions is being put in place and will be put up shortly on this site.

The [Knowledge project](https://github.com/fkanlab/knowledge) will collate scientific knowledge around Fluoride and Fluorosis. This project will make extensive use of the [Wiki](https://github.com/fkanlab/knowledge/wiki). More details on how you can contribute will be put up shortly.

In addition, there will be repositories on several open source / freely licensed solutions around water treatment, testing, nutrition, etc. These too will be summarized and announced on these pages.
